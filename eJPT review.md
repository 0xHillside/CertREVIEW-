# My eJPT experience
## Disclaimers
If you don't care about anything I say about myself that's fine, go ahead and skip to the **Technicalities** portion of the article. 

# Introduction
I got into this cert fully knowing that I'm probably at the same level or maybe even higher than the material being provided, Whilst I really enjoyed the material being displayed I will remain honest and critical, in a certificate that has 148 (now 150ish after the update) is it REALLY necessary to have a module that's  a total of 50 HOURS? ONLY about METASPLOIT?, if it was anything useful sure but I did some calculation and it would be 3 HOURS worth of content before even actually learning how to LAUNCH IT. it was extremely disheartening to see knowing that 50 hours where just filler like that. 

My second complaint is the web section, I would have DEFINITELY appreciated some more indepth look into the manual exploitation of vulnerabilities rather than just their tools and my third was for them to fire josh mason for his absolutely SHIT explanation but theyre already removing his content so I guess everything got fixed!

## Preparations.

- transferring files from and to targets (both windows and Linux)
- vulnerability assessment using searchsploit (requires some actual thinking)
- Pivoting using Metasploit's autoroute
- Privilege escalation
	- Credential hunting
	- looking for misconfigured permission on binaries
